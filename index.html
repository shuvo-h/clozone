                    One of the most common questions asked by prospective students at Animation Apprentice is about employability - how easy is it to find work in the animation industry?  After all, it's all very well to train animators to do excellent work, but the key thing is to turn that knowledge into a successful career.

But there is another way of dealing with the perpetual uncertainty of finding paid work in the arts - and that is to start your own business. So how, exactly, might you go about doing that?
